# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: June 30th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've had some fun with React components (+ conditional rendering) and [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API). Researched more the JavaScript modules topic.

**Thoughts:**: Planning is a crucial part of writing software. When I get the Geolocation right I will try to fetch the data with [Axios](https://github.com/borowyalan/weather-app).

### Day 2: June 29th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've revised the modern JavaScript features used extensively in React Application.

**Thoughts:** It's best not to delay the learning until late. Getting the work (learning) done just after you start the day, fresh, seems to be optimal. Still managed to get something done, without the real code to show tho.

### Day 1: June 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned a little about using objects and constructors in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am slowly diving into the world of JavaScript. I hope to get the basics well, so I can continue learning with a good foundation.
