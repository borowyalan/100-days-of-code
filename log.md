# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 9: July 7th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Successfully implemented GeolocationContext to provide the values in both nodes of the App. Extracted the API call for reverseGeocoding to a helper file as a promise.

**Thoughts:**: The more you learn the more you see you could use someone experienced to tell you if the design/implementation decisions you've made are right. Like a mentor ðŸŽ“

### Day 8: July 5rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added GeolocationProvider components allowing two panes to use the geolocation. Done using [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

### Day 7: July 4rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restructured the app to Split Pane View using [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components). 

**Thoughts:**: Deciding about technology used in simple projects doesn't matter as long as it allows you to get the job done and explore the solution a little.

### Day 6: July 3rd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added a placeholder in case the [GeolocationAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) fails using [Conditional Rendering](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html) in React. Added a mechanism allowing rendering the localization properly.

**Thoughts:**: The Geolocation component wasn't rendering the city/country format correctly due to hardcoded values fetched from dynamic API. The lack of consistency in your app is a bug, even when at a glance it looks fine.

### Day 5: July 2nd, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned about & added the [Reverse Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/geocoding-reverse) to app using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios).

**Thoughts:**: Figuring things out is sometimes a struggle, but it's satisfying when you can easily reproduce the effects afterwards and the code comes to the simple and structured form. ðŸŽˆ

### Day 4: July 1st, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Geolocation component which now displays lon and lat correctly.

**Thoughts:**: Working in the morning when you are fresh is indeed a good idea.

### Day 3: June 30th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've had some fun with React components (+ conditional rendering) and [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API). Researched more the JavaScript modules topic.

**Thoughts:**: Planning is a crucial part of writing software. When I get the Geolocation right I will try to fetch the data with [Axios](https://github.com/borowyalan/weather-app).

### Day 2: June 29th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've revised the modern JavaScript features used extensively in React Application.

**Thoughts:** It's best not to delay the learning until late. Getting the work (learning) done just after you start the day, fresh, seems to be optimal. Still managed to get something done, without the real code to show tho.

### Day 1: June 28th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Learned a little about using objects and constructors in JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I am slowly diving into the world of JavaScript. I hope to get the basics well, so I can continue learning with a good foundation.
